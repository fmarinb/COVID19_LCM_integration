In case of positive results in the classification model, the pipeline has continued with (iv) identification of motifs by Motif_Identification() and obtaining the Residue Sensitivity Logos for each cluster (v). This workflow has been applied in all supervised analysis scripts. The procedure has been developed given the scripts deposited at https://github.com/sidhomj/DeepTCR_COVID19, whose results are published at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93608-8\n",

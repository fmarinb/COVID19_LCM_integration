    "The pipeline consists of (i), creation or reloading of the work area via Get_Data(), (ii) creation of the repertoire classification model via Monte_Carlo_CrossVal(), and (iii) representation of the AUC-ROC curve. In case of positive results in the classification model, the pipeline has continued with (iv) identification of motifs by Motif_Identification() and obtaining the Residue Sensitivity Logos for each cluster (v). This workflow has been applied in all supervised analysis scripts. The procedure has been developed given the scripts deposited at https://github.com/sidhomj/DeepTCR_COVID19, whose results are published at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93608-8\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** The supervised model analyses stored in the .ipynb *cluster1vcluster2*, *cluster1vcluster3*, *cluster2vcluster3* and *severity* scripts have the same structure and code blocks (except the RSL logo code blocks in *cluster2vcluster3* and *severity* files), with corresponding differences in terms of sample directories, variable and file names. Therefore, for further simplification, more detailed workflow comments have been added in the *cluster1vcluster3.ipynb* script, applicable to the rest of the scripts, which retain basic documentation."
